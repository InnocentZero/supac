:END:

Supac is a declarative package manager written in rust, and configurable in [[https://github.com/nushell/nushell][nushell]].
It is meant to emulate nix but without the headaches that come along with it. It does
not maintain packages by itself but rather hooks with the existing package managers on your
system to configure them in a declarative fashion.

** Support

Right now the following package managers are supported:
- Arch Linux (any of your package managers capable of elevating permissions by themselves)
- Flatpak (user mode configuration)
- Cargo

** Checklist of package managers
